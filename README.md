# Project Soul

I haven't fully decided on the name yet.

So, what is this? Well, this is my little project that I do in my free time.
It's a third person Roguelike game inspired by Thaumcraft and souls. By that I mean the so called spirit inside our bodies, not the game genre.

The game will basically be about going around a dungeon, looting and trying to gear up and a lot of fighting. There might be a story to the game but hey, first I want to make something that at least partically represents a game.
