# Project Soul

I haven't fully decided on the name yet.

So, what is this? Well, this is my little project that I do in my free time.
It's a First person Roguelike game inspired by Thaumcraft and souls. By that I mean the so called spirit inside our bodies, not the game genre.

The game will basically be about going around a dungeon, looting and trying to gear up and a lot of fighting. There might be a story to the game but hey, first I want to make something that at least partically represents a game.

## Player Model

The second one has Goggles of Revealing as a small test for equipable armor.

## Shambling Husk Model

Which is also the most basic enemy that you can encounter in the game.

#### Textures are not final! They were made when I was just messing around because I didn't want to walk around as a white cube!
